## libft
***This project creates a library with standard libc functions and some other generic functions.***

The purpose or this project is not to reinvent the wheels. But it helps us to develop a deep understanding of the standard libc functions and how to use them. 

## Getting started

### Compilation

Run the following commands:

* To compile
	- `make`
* To remove object files:
	- `make clean`
* To remove object files and executable:
	- `make fclean`
* To re-compile:
	- `make re`

### How to test

To test the library, compile with your program. i.e.

`./program libft.a`
