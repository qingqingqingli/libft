# libft
***This project creates a library with standard libc functions and several other generic functions, which will be used for other 42 projects.***

The purpose is not to reinvent the wheels, but to help us to develop a deep understanding of the standard libc functions and how to use them. 

---

## Technical considerations
- Allowed functions: malloc, free, write
- All heap allocated memory space must be properly freed when necessary

## Compilation

Run the following commands:

* To compile
	- `make`
* To remove object files:
	- `make clean`
* To remove object files and executable:
	- `make fclean`
* To re-compile:
	- `make re`

## How to test

To test the library, compile with your program. i.e.

`./program libft.a`
